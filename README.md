This repository demonstrates setting up a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application. The workflow includes steps for installing Node.js, installing dependencies, running tests, and optionally building and deploying the application.

Prerequisites
GitHub account and repository
Basic understanding of Git and GitHub
Node.js and npm installed locally (for development)

GitHub Actions Workflow Setup
1. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a .github/workflows Directory:

Open your project directory.
Create a new directory named .github/workflows if it doesn't exist already.

Define the GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create a new YAML file, for example nodejs-ci.yml, inside .github/workflows directory.
